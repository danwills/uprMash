UPRMash - a python script for mangling UltraFractal UPR files.

What does it do?

It adds extra layers to an animated UltraFractal fractal to create motion blurred fractals, add animation to create loops, and other cool time-blending effects.
Why would you want to do this? UF already has motion blur, doesn't it?

UF does add a motion blurring effect based on the animation of the 'location' settings of a layer, but only zooms, panning and rotation will create this blur, not fractal parameter changes.

I have always wanted to see what it would look like to motion blur a fractal as you vary the parameters, some fractals change in very interesting ways as their parameters vary.

It's also a nice departure from the rather digital artifact of being perfectly in focus everywhere. I am also interested in setting up some fractals with parameter-focal blur (aka Depth-of-Field) but I'll leave that for a future project :D

I am comitting it to gitHub because I noticed that the wiki is getting some traffic and only the py2exe (for windows) conversion is available.. hopefully making the source available will make it more useful to anyone wanting to play with it.
